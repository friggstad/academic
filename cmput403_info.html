        <p>
          <i>Comment: The information below is tailored to how I run the course.
            Other instructors run the course in a similar manner, but there may
            be deviations.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note</b>: No part of this should be taken as official (i.e. not part of the course outline).
          This is just an information page that is subject to change at any time and may
          disagree with a current offering of CMPUT 403.
        </p>

        <h3>What Is This Course?</h3>

        <p>
          I frequently get asked what this course is about. The
          <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/undergraduate-studies/course-directory/courses/practical-algorithms.html" target = "_blank">
          university calendar description</a> is a bit cryptic.
        </p>

        <p>
          This course was born from an individual study in problem solving for programming contests.
          But interest has grown quite a bit, in part due to the fact that many interviews
          have a problem component: the famous "interview questions". Others like this course because
          the myriad of coding assignments help develop
          experience with both coding and debugging (in addition to problem solving).
        </p>

        <p>
          This course retains the "individual study" feel in the following sense:
          lecture content is not as in-depth with particular topics as, say, CMPUT 304.
          Rather, you are pointed to information on various algorithms and problem solving paradigms
          and it is understood that you will use this information to help solve problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our meeting times are restricted to only 2 hours/week where the focus of the in-class
          discussions will be highlighting key aspects of the weekly topic plus some examples
          of problems we can solve using the highlighted techniques.
          You are encouraged to also attend out <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~contest/">Programming Club</a>
          meetings where similar problems are discussed, but this is not required.
        </p>

        <h3>Nature of the Course Work</h3>

        <p>
          Primarily, you will be solving problems. This means you read a description,
          design an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, implement it,
          and have it <font color="green"><b>ACCEPTED</b></font> by an automated judging platform that tests your solution
          on some hidden data (that conforms to the problem specification).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you don't know what that means, go to <a href="https://open.kattis.com/" target="_blank">Open Kattis</a>,
          create an account, and try to solve some very easy problems. You can sort the problems by difficulty by clicking on the column header on the Problems page. Make sure you "submit" your solution
          to see the judgement. Notice: it is <b>all or nothing</b>. If you don't pass all test cases, it is not "accepted".
        </p>

        <p>
          You will do this time after time after time in CMPUT 403 on a Kattis tailored for U of A courses. There will be weekly problem sets consisting usually of 3-4 problems,
          the first week is an exception because you solve more (6 or 7) but most are on the easy side. If you get a problem "accepted" before the deadline, you get full marks.
          There are no partial marks for an incorrect solution, the only partial marks you may earn are with late submissions (according to the course outline). You have 2 weeks
          to complete each problem set and a new set is released each week, which means in general there are 2 active problem sets at any given time.
        </p>

        <p>
          There will likely be a final project instead of a final exam. This will involve you selecting an algorithm that is more involved than what we usually talk about
          during the weekly topics and providing a complete implementation that I can easily run on my machine.
        </p>

        <h3>Programming Language</h3>
        <p>
          There are 2 facets to this topic:
          <ul>
            <li>The official language of <b>instruction</b> is C++.
              That is, all sample code I present during the lectures and posted to eClass is written in C++.
              I prefer C++ because it strikes the right balance between
              efficiency and versatility. It is usually as fast or nearly as fast as C or other lower-level languages,
              but the standard template library contains many indispensible data structures and algorithms not available
              in the standard library of C.</li>
            <li>You may still solve problems in any language supported by <a href="https://open.kattis.com/" target="_blank">Open Kattis</a> which includes Python3 and Java.<br>
              <b>Caveats</b>: Python3 typically runs 2x - 3x slower than C++. The site uses the Python3 interpreter pypy3 which is usually <b>much</b>
              more efficient than cpython, but still slower than C++. In some cases, it can run much slower than C++; I have seen running times of 15x slower than C++ even though the implementations look identical apart from
              the obvious language differences. Java is also noticeably slower than C++.
              The majority of problems issued in CMPUT 403 can be solved by Python or Java. But occasionally there are problems that are frustrating to solve in these languages.
              You can always view the statistics page for a problem to see how successful Python or Java submissions tend to be (eg. <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/minibattleship/statistics">this page for the problem Mini Battleship</a>).<br>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To get the most learning out of this course, I encourage you to use C++. It is not required, many students succeed just using Python or Java.
            But learning to use C++ effectively will expand your coding abilities. If you want to practice beforehand, I recommend you learn how to use
            the data structures and algorithms in the Standard Template Library. For example: linked lists, queues, vectors, priority_queue, set, map, unordered_set, unordered_map,
            sort() function, and spend time getting used to iterators in the STL. Also, get used to the I/O stream model used in C++ (eg. cin and cout) as it is quite different
            than the line-by-line input approach taken by Python.
          </p>
        </p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          The formal prerequisites are CMPUT 204 and at least one 300-level (or above) CMPUT course.
          The point of asking for at least one 300-level CMPUT course is to encourage you to take CMPUT 403
          sometime later in your studies. Unless you are an active member of the programming club or participate in
          contests like <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam">Google Code Jam</a> / <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart">Kickstart</a>, <a href="https://icpc.global/">ICPC</a>, <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a>, etc,
          you may struggle to keep up with the workload in this course more in your earlier years of study.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some algorithms used in this course are taught in CMPUT 304, but you can pick them up during the readings.
          Students who have not taken CMPUT 304 tend to spend extra time learning about <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/edmonds_karp.html">network flow</a>
          and <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/kuhn_maximum_bipartite_matching.html">bipartite matching</a>, so you can read up on these topics ahead of time if you wish.
          They will appear in the latter half of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          To emphasize, it is strongly encouraged that you wait until your 3rd or 4th year of studies before taking this course
          unless you already have extensive experience solving problems of this nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Math topics that pop up include (but are not necessarily limited too):
          <ul>
            <li>Solving a system of equations: Gaussian Elimination.</li>
            <li>Matrices, especially multiplication.</li>
            <li>Basics of modular arithmetic. You should know what "arithmetic mod m" means where m is a positive integer.
              <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/module-inverse.html">Modular inverses</a> are discussed as well
              (we will discuss the method using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm).</li>
            <li>The basics of prime numbers and prime factorization. Nothing too in-depth.</li>
            <li>Basic geometry, it is all elementary (eg. how to represent the line between 2 points,
              how to compute the intersection points of 2 circles, etc.).</li>
            <li>Dot products and cross products in 2D: simple applications.</li>
            <li>There are other small topics, but this should give you an idea of what we will see.</li>
          </ul>
          In some sense, everything we do as problem solvers is "math". I suppose I am just giving an impression
          of topics that typically do not appear in our algorithms courses.
        </p>

        <h3>Textbook</h3>
        <p>
          There is no required textbook, but there is a highly-suggested book.
          <a href="https://cpbook.net/details?cp=4">Competitive Programming 4</a> (both "books",
          so you get all of Chapters 1 - 9). The sequence of topics in CMPUT 403 loosely follows this book and
          the book contains excellent additional problem suggestions from a spectrum of difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bookstore will adopt this book, but they will ask students
          to pre-register for a copy or else there will be a shipping delay.
          I will email all students registered for the course once the bookstore
          starts taking orders. Alternatively, you can just order your own copy
          directly from the site. Expect a few weeks for shipping.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strongly recommend the 4th edition.
          The 3rd edition will not be quite as nice. A few new topics appear in the 4th edition
          and they expanded the list of suggested problems to include problems from
          <a href="https://open.kattis.com/">Kattis</a>, which will be the platform used
          in CMPUT 403.
        </p>


        <h3>Is This Course Right For You?</h3>
        <p>
          Be prepared to spend many hours coding and debugging each week, especially if you do not have
          programming club experience. Note: only some students in CMPUT 403 are active members
          of the programming club. You will be among many peers if you do not have this background.
        </p>
        <p>
          The topics in this course change rapidly. One week, you are solving geometry problems.
          Then the next week, you might be solving problems in combinatorics. Then string algorithms.
          Then graph algorithms. Then data structures.
          This can be jarring for some.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you self-motivated to read up on topics you might not be familiar with? You will do this a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want a more hands-on impression of the sort of problems we will encounter,
          here are a few samples along with my opinion on their
          diffulty compared with the average problem issued in CMPUT 403.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/delimitersoup">Delimiter Soup</a> (very easy)</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/froshweek2">Frosh Week 2</a> (easy)</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/importspaghetti">Import Spaghetti</a> (normal, graph algorithm)</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/spiderman">Spiderman's Workout</a> (normal, dynamic programming)</li>
          </ul>
          Don't just solve these in your head: implement them and get them accepted on the online judge! For example, "Import Spaghetti" is
          not so hard conceptually but you have to get a few implementation details just right in order to have it accepted.
          Working through these will give you a very strong impression of the sort of work you can expect in this course.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, you can contact me for more information on this course if you have further questions.
