        <h2>CMPUT 403 - Practical Algorithmics</h2>

        <p>
          I frequently get asked what this course is about. The
          <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/undergraduate-studies/course-directory/courses/practical-algorithms.html" target = "_blank">
          university calendar description</a> is a bit cryptic.
        </p>

        <p>
          This course was born from an individual study in problem solving for programming contests.
          But interest has grown quite a bit, in part due to the fact that many interviews
          have a problem solving and/or coding component. The assignments also give you extensive
          experience with both coding and debugging (in addition to problem solving).
        </p>

        <p>
          This course retains the "individual study" feel in the following sense:
          lecture content is not as in-depth with particular topics as, say, CMPUT 304.
          Rather, you are pointed to information on various algorithms and problem solving paradigms
          and it is understood that you will use this information to help solve problems.
          Our meeting times are restricted to only 2 hours/week where the focus of the in-class
          discussions will be highlighting key aspects of the weekly topic I find useful
          and examples of how to solve a few particular problems related to the topic.
        </p>

        <h3>Nature of the Course Work</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Comment: The information below is tailored to how I run the course.
            Other instructors run the course in a similar manner, but there may
            be deviations.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Primarily, you will be solving problems. This means you read a description,
          design an efficient-enough algorithm to solve the problem, implement it,
          and have it "accepted" by an automated judging platform that tests your solution
          on some hidden data (that conforms to the problem specification).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you don't really know what that means, go to <a href="https://open.kattis.com/" target="_blank">Open Kattis</a>,
          create an account, and try to solve some very easy problems (difficulty at most 2.0). Make sure you "submit" your solution
          to see the judgement. Notice: it is <b>all or nothing</b>. If you don't pass all test cases, it is not "accepted".
        </p>

        <p>
          You will do this time after time after time in CMPUT 403 on a Kattis site (like Open Kattis but tailored for U of A courses). There will be weekly problem sets consisting of 3-4 problems
          (apart from the first week, which has quite a bit more but most are easy). If you get it "accepted" before the deadline, you get full marks.
          There are no partial marks for an incorrect solution, the only partial marks you may earn are with late submissions (according to the course outline).
        </p>

        <h3>Programming Language</h3>
        <p>
          There are 2 facets to this topic:
          <ul>
            <li>The official language of <b>instruction</b> is C++.
              That is, all sample code I present during the lectures and posted to eClass is in C++.
              This is because C++ strikes the right balance between
              efficiency and versatility (eg. it is usually as fast or nearly as fast as C
              but the standard template library contains many indispensible data structures and algorithms).</li><br>
            <li>You may still solve problems in any language supported by <a href="https://open.kattis.com/" target="_blank">Open Kattis</a> which includes Python3 and Java.<br><br>
              <b>Caveats</b>: Python3 typically runs 2x - 3x slower than C++. The site uses the Python3 interpreter pypy3 which is usually <b>much</b>
              more efficient than cpython, but still slower than C++. In some cases, it can run much slower than C++; I have seen running times of 15x slower than C++ even though the implementations look identical apart from
              the obvious language differences. Java is also noticeably slower than C++.
              The majority of problems issued in CMPUT 403 can be solved by Python or Java. But occasionally there are problems that are frustrating to solve in these languages.
              You can always view the statistics page for a problem to see how successful Python or Java submissions tend to be.
          </ul>
          <p>
            To get the most learning out of this course, I encourage you to use C++. It is not required, many students succeed just using Python or Java.
            But learning to use C++ effectively will expand your coding abilities. If you want to get some practice, learn how to use
            the data structures and algorithms in the Standard Template Library (eg. linked lists, queues, vectors, priority_queue, set, map, unordered_set, unordered_map,
            sort() function, and spend time getting used to iterators in the STL).
          </p>
        </p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          The formal prerequisites are CMPUT 204 and at least one 300-level (or above) CMPUT.
          The point of asking for at least one 300-level CMPUT course is to encourage you to take CMPUT 403
          sometime later in your studies. Unless you are an active member of the programming club,
          you may struggle with the workload in this course more in your earlier years of study.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some algorithms used in this course are taught in CMPUT 304, but you can pick them up during the readings.
          Students who have not taken CMPUT 304 tend to spend extra time learning about <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/edmonds_karp.html">network flow</a>
          and <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/kuhn_maximum_bipartite_matching.html">bipartite matching</a>, so if you plan on taking this course you can consider
          this something to brush up on (it will appear later in the course as one of the more advanced topics).
        </p>
        <p>
          To emphasize, it is strongly encouraged that you wait until your 3rd or 4th year of studies before taking this course
          unless you already have extensive experience solving problems of this nature (eg. if you participate in programming contests
          like Google Kickstart / Code Jam, ICPC, etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Math topics that pop up include (but are not necessarily limited too):
          <ul>
            <li>Solving a system of equations: Gaussian Elimination.</li>
            <li>Matrices, especially multiplication.</li>
            <li>Basics of modular arithmetic. You should know what "arithmetic mod m" means where m is a positive integer.
              <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/module-inverse.html">Modular inverses</a> are discussed as well
              (we will discuss the method using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm).</li>
            <li>The basics of prime numbers and prime factorization. Nothing too in-depth.</li>
            <li>Basic geometry, it is all elementary (eg. how to represent the line between 2 points,
              how to compute the intersection points of 2 circles, etc.).</li>
            <li>Dot products and cross products in 2D: simple applications.</li>
            <li>There are other small topics, but this should give you an idea of what we will see.</li>
          </ul>
          In some sense, everything we do as problem solvers is "math". I guess I'm just giving a list
          of topics that typically do not appear in our algorithms courses.
